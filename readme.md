# To Do
- Needs to adjust APY and interest rate based on market economics.
- Contract needs to have at least "x" percent in reserve.
- The higher the loan amount, the shorter the length of the loan.
- There needs to be an incentive to pay back the loan faster when reserve is low.
- After "x" percent days late, loan needs to expire.
